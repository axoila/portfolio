                    Hello,
                </p>
                <p>
                    my name is Ronja B&ouml;hringer, I'm a programmer currently looking for a work placement in the games industry. <br/>
                    I am experienced in Unity with C# and Shaderlab, but I've also used Java, Javascript and C++ in the past and I'm always curious to learn more.

                <h2>No Time For Apocalypse</h2>

                    A university project I did with two fellow students. In the game you help people with their tasks and then fight the horsemen of the apocalypse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game includes 4 levels with one bossfight each and a completely interactive dialogue System based on Yarnspinner.

                <p>
                    Though we weren't able to get the game to a state where I'm 100% happy with it we released it as it is because of time constraints. 
                    The core development time of the project was about 4 months with some polishing done by myself afterwards. <br/>

                    I often make small games in short amounts of time or in small groups at gamejams.
                    <br/>
                    Some of my favourite projects I participated on so far are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When attending Gamescom 2017 to represent my university, a small group of three students, including me, made this small game.
                                To fit the unique requirements of such a event, we decided to make a local competetive multiplayer game. 
                                It ended up encompassing 2 different levels.

                                A small fangame for "The Inner World". It plays in the same world as the adventure and you 
                                play as the pidgeon hack as you try to avoid getting caught by the basyls and do pidgeon things (eat breadcrumbs).

                                This game was made for the MelonGameJam leading up to AMAZE 2017. As a

                    Currently I'm part of a 70 people strong university project where I'm managing the programming team together with one other student. 
                    At the end of the current semester we're going to present the game at a event we're organizing.

                    The game will be top down shooter with puzzle elements in a aztec setting with a stylized cellshading look.
