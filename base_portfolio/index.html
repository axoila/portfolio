                        my name is Ronja B&ouml;hringer, I'm a programmer currently 
                        looking for a work placement in the games industry. My expertise is on prototyping and graphics programming,
						but I always want to learn new things.
						<br/>
						I'm experienced at prototyping small games as well as working with groups on bigger projects.

                    This game was originally developed live at the Gamescom 2017 <a href="https://www.hs-mittweida.de/">HSMW</a> booth.
                    We chose to make a competetive multiplayer game with simple controls, because the unique environment gave us new players every few minutes, 
                    with wildly variying skill levels, often in small groups. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I added a few quality of life changes like a pause menu as well improving the overall architecture and code quality after the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find the game at <a href="https://redye.itch.io/neon-overdrive" target="_blank">https://redye.itch.io/neon-overdrive</a>

                <h1>No Time For Apocalypse</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>Role:</b> Management, Design, Programming
                </p>
                <p>
                    A university project I did with two fellow students. In the game you help people with their tasks and then fight the horsemen of the apocalypse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game includes 4 levels with one bossfight each and a completely interactive dialogue System based on Yarnspinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though we weren't able to get the game to a state where I'm 100% happy with it, we learned a lot from it as it and decided to release it as it is.<br/>
                    The core development time of the project was about 4 months with a bit polishing done by myself afterwards.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm part of a 70 people strong university project where I'm managing the programming team together with one other student. 
                    At the end of the semester we're going to present the game at a event we're organizing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the game you team up with a death god who looks like a dog to survive the dangerous dungeon of a opressive sun god and eventually face them.
